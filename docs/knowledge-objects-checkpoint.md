# Knowledge objects implementation checkpoint

**Goal status:** active
**Current milestone:** KO-0 catalog runtime prerequisites
**Last completed slice:** KO-0D authorization-first read-only catalog runtime
**Evidence date:** August 7, 2026

## Durable checkpoint

- Published KO-0 foundation: inclusive `00c88c1` through `b7ac77b`
- KO-0D local implementation range: `c5440b9..c8b9757`
- KO-0D terminal local revision:
  `c8b97576ed21d1acf5d77c2c48dbbb05585627dd`
- Branch: `codex/knowledge-objects-runtime`
- Publication state: six intentional KO-0D commits are durable locally. An
  attempted push to `git@github.com:Suhaibinator/open-splunk.git` was blocked
  by the execution environment's unverified-destination egress policy. No
  bypass was attempted; explicit approval for that exact destination is still
  required before this branch can be published.
- Scope: lifecycle- and commitment-aware protobuf contracts, canonical known
  and inactive-future definitions, migration 0029 state authorities, and a
  bounded read-only `Get`/`List` catalog with current-identity authorization,
  historical reads, quarantine redaction, keyset pagination, dependency and
  lifecycle validation, transactionally coherent read views, and detached
  results.
- Runtime feature state: the capability and routes remain hard-disabled and
  unadvertised. Production mutation, resolver/snapshot construction, search
  admission, UI, and ClickHouse knowledge execution are not implemented.

The separate pre-existing dependency commit `fdcc17e` is also present in the
published `main` history. Unrelated commits between KO checkpoints are excluded
from the ranges above; no history rewrite or alternate publication branch was
used.

## Contract decisions frozen

- Binary case-sensitive identities with a stable ASCII-only trim/control rule
- Private → current-app → tenant-global shadow precedence
- Administrator-only, tenant-bound v0.1 management APIs
- Server-authoritative index scope and per-row trusted metadata selectors
- Parallel extraction, alias, and calculated stages before the authored base
  predicate, with no same-stage chaining
- `_raw`-only extraction and existing authored `rex`/`spath` typed semantics
- Copy aliases that preserve their source and explicit missing/null/overwrite
  behavior
- Reserved/canonical event roots cannot be knowledge destinations
- Scope-monotonic, same-tenant dependencies and bounded graph validation
- Append-only versions, exact mutation idempotency, catalog revisions, and
  detached immutable snapshots
- One-transaction coherent resolver reads and deterministic snapshot digest
  framing
- Current-policy response redaction for retained provenance and inspection
- Binary UTF-8 substring and individual-selector-pattern filters applied before
  keyset `LIMIT` at one catalog revision
- Exact sealed current-version projection verification, canonical selector
  framing, and a 256 MiB per-tenant projection byte ceiling
- Historical Get authorized from the current identity, with permanent
  definition redaction while the current identity is quarantined
- Atomic successful-mutation audit metadata and a separate fail-closed rejected
  privileged-attempt journal that retains no unauthorized object metadata
- Catalog, resolver, cache, selector, expression, snapshot, and audit ceilings
- Terminal corruption quarantine with bounded dependent closure, protected
  version/idempotency capacity, and one recovery-audit slot for every lifetime
  physical identity

The compatibility inventory contains 55 hash-pinned cases. It is explicitly a
strict contract inventory, not yet runtime semantic evidence. Before the field
feature is advertised, every relevant case must acquire concrete catalog/event
inputs and exact typed outputs or diagnostics and execute through production
normalization, resolution, planning, compilation, and ClickHouse paths.

## Independent adversarial review

Three independent reviewers covered security/authorization, semantic
compatibility, and systems/concurrency/resource behavior. All credible findings
were resolved and each reviewer returned a clean final verdict.

Resolved security findings included dependency-scope laundering, corruption as
an existence oracle, missing CRUD/preview privilege rules, retained-inspection
authorization ambiguity, and an underdefined audit taxonomy.

Resolved semantic findings included reserved/canonical output hazards,
inconsistent Bytes and optional-capture behavior versus authored `rex`,
ambiguous JSON Bytes behavior, an unsupported arithmetic example, and a fixture
claim stronger than its implementation.

Resolved systems findings included mixed-revision snapshots, incomplete digest
canonicalization, unbounded catalog/cache/resolver work, selector input rescans,
Unicode-version-dependent normalization, lost-response create retries, hard-cap
recovery deadlocks, corrupt-object quarantine, transitive dependent recovery,
general-audit exhaustion, repeated cascade transitions, and replacement-
generation recovery capacity.

KO-0B received additional independent protobuf, selector, and migration review.
Resolved protobuf findings covered calculated-field overwrite authority,
create-only draft state, accidental capability advertisement, definition-
relative masks, contradictory provenance shapes, current-policy redaction,
non-self-referential snapshot byte charging, and raw unknown-field rejection.

Resolved selector findings covered the 16-versus-17 segment storage/search
boundary, uncharged epsilon work, cancellation during a worst-case matcher,
mixed exact/wildcard canonical ordering, duplicate normalization, and multi-
pattern reference fuzzing.

Resolved migration findings covered incomplete or later-mutated dependency
sets, activation under archived apps, disabling/deleting targets with active
dependents, detached version success records, `INSERT OR REPLACE` bypasses,
NULL-safe registry/version digest agreement, bodyless terminal quarantine, and
failure rollback. A deferred immutable dependency seal now proves the exact
ordinal set before a current registry generation can commit.

KO-0C received three further independent security full-file review shards plus
independent correctness, concurrency, compatibility, performance, and
simplification review. All 39 source-like files in the exact
`b42b046..b7ac77b` diff received unique completion receipts. No plausible
security candidate survived discovery.

Resolved projection findings included a missing reverse current-version
projection invariant, undercharged description and selector bytes, missing
8 KiB canonical framing enforcement, selector ordering/duplicate gaps,
recursive-trigger behavior, and insufficient proof that correlated filters
deduplicate before keyset `LIMIT`.

Resolved successful-audit findings included missing app/type/scope metadata,
insufficient preflight width bounds, cursor digests that did not bind the new
metadata, migration tests that accidentally included later schema, and list
lookahead allocation/ownership issues.

Resolved rejected-attempt findings included disclosure-prone metadata shapes,
an inexact configurable retention ceiling, corrupt-boundary append/eviction,
redundant persisted authorization state, repeated startup scans and
allocations, sequence exhaustion, and recursive-trigger/`OR REPLACE`
tampering. The final journal records no request payloads, error strings,
derived authorization booleans, or unauthorized object metadata.

The formal Codex Security bundle used scan ID
`6e16ec57-6a8b-4bf3-a5d6-11502a0b229b`, exact binary-diff snapshot
`codex-security-snapshot/v1:sha256:3d8a3fbd70b8f42512d21123a68c71b8a2b6acdb62500b7c0897f23b69b656d9`,
39/39 source-like receipts, complete coverage, and zero reportable findings.
The desktop finalizer first rejected the unsealed manifest because its range
launcher omitted `scan.target.snapshotDigest`. The same evidence bundle was
repaired with the digest of the exact full-index binary Git diff and sealed by
the plugin's local contract validator. Final SHA-256 values are
`93c3b8fdc1f17ac64e5a0c6f048caefb10d4ca27b3812fe932f64ad8c957da5d`
for `scan-manifest.json`,
`51122d213e5c9ddf109c063835b744374051847f5ef036a6d65916908b731cb4`
for `findings.json`,
`d914dcd1313e509ef34a45466b42655ec8b7d12ecece5b15b019c1f73ebf13dc`
for `coverage.json`, and
`0614b235166c28c42fc31cf31cb8ae04a62db36c21894af30738e8146fd31010`
for the deterministic `report.md` projection. The workbench row remains
terminally failed from the launcher omission; the locally sealed bundle is the
canonical review evidence.

KO-0D used dedicated, independent test lanes throughout: one owned unit,
property, fuzz, and compatibility reference models; one owned store/API,
SQLite, concurrency, migration, crash/recovery, and integration matrices; and
rotating specialists reviewed protobufs, authorization/privacy, lifecycle,
migration/recovery, compatibility, performance, and simplification. Production
implementers were not the sole reviewers of their corresponding tests.

The pre-remediation frozen KO-0D review candidate had binary full-diff SHA-256
`f5cc1ac98fa7d4d4ce4d50d2b09c6435ab99f782cac95c5d4aea2be8686b159f`.
Security review returned clean. Correctness and concurrency review identified a
missing hostile-width case for dependency target identities and a stale query-
driver comment. The added test then exposed a failure-path cleanup weakness in
its own corruption harness. The correctness remediation rereview was clean at
SHA-256 `dd02aad8451ccc4a58efb32bb145448c4e765f22c9f0eb0df0f23a1346fd4e76`.
After failure-safe cleanup was added, the focused test passed five times
normally and under race, and the concurrency/resource cleanup rereview returned
clean on the final KO-0D binary full diff. Its SHA-256 is
`53c28d93c5adfcdcbd448c32e64f8633469930aee923b6a4de9f87308d6717f4`,
derived exactly by
`git diff --binary c5440b9..c8b9757 | shasum -a 256`.

Earlier frozen reviews in the same slice found and resolved revision-ledger
coupling, dependency graph agreement, lifecycle chronology, quadratic upgrade
backfill, unsafe private SQLite test instrumentation, projection materialization
before byte checks, selector/dependency pre-LIMIT work amplification,
non-deterministic WAL overlap tests, semantic-budget cursor coverage, and rogue
projection starvation. The final implementation uses public test hooks only,
streams guarded projection payloads, starts projection authorization from
bounded authorized registry branches, and proves read transactions are wholly
old or wholly new across a concurrent WAL commit.

The formal security-diff workflow was not claimed for KO-0D: its attempted
snapshot became stale while concurrent agents were still editing, and that
workflow disallowed substituting a new scan in the same pass. The independent
frozen-hash security rereview above is the applicable KO-0D security evidence.

For KO-0C, the first sandboxed full-suite attempt failed only where existing
tests bind loopback sockets or exercise host ACL behavior. The identical suite passed with
the required local execution permission. KO-0C changed SQLite migrations and
therefore exercised fresh, upgrade, rollback, corruption, recovery-adjacent,
recursive-trigger, concurrency, and capacity behavior. It did not add browser
or ClickHouse runtime behavior, so Docker-backed ClickHouse and browser
verticals were not applicable. No licensed Splunk oracle was available or
used; this checkpoint makes no differential-equivalence claim.

KO-0D likewise adds no server route, browser surface, resolver, search
admission, or ClickHouse knowledge execution. Browser and Docker-backed
knowledge verticals therefore remain future hard gates rather than skipped
acceptance evidence. Existing frontend tests and ClickHouse package tests pass,
the feature stays hard-disabled, and no licensed Splunk oracle was available.

## Next dependency-ordered work

The migration, audit-schema/primitives, definition, and read-only catalog hard
gates are complete. Writer and route-level audit integration remains required.
The next slice continues KO-0 in dependency order:

1. add production `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, and separately contracted
   `SetState` publication transactions with exact idempotency replay, optimistic
   version matching, field masks, immutable blob/version/projection/dependency
   authorities, revision-token rotation, successful audit, and rejected-attempt
   journaling all-or-none;
2. add writer failpoints and subprocess kill/reopen tests at every transaction
   boundary, including lost responses, concurrent optimistic races, capacity
   reserves, rollback, restart, and idempotent convergence;
3. add administrator-only protobuf HTTP routes that derive tenant, owner, app,
   and privilege state solely from the validated principal and fail closed when
   rejected-attempt journaling is unavailable;
4. implement the one-transaction resolver and detached immutable snapshot
   builder, including precedence, shadow inventory, authorized-index pinning,
   canonical cross-language digest framing, cache bounds, and old-or-new
   admission races; and
5. add the hidden Knowledge Manager list/detail shell plus negative API,
   capability-advertisement, route-registration, and navigation tests; keep the
   feature unadvertised and navigation absent while the runtime is incomplete;
   and
6. integrate snapshot persistence into search lifecycle/provenance before
   beginning KO-1 field execution. Keep ACTIVE publication and the feature flag
   disabled until the complete Tier-1 vertical and its browser and ClickHouse
   acceptance tests pass.
